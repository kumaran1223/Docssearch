Creative Brief: "Everyday Moments" Brand Campaign
===================================================

Project: Brand Refresh Campaign 2024
Client: Internal Marketing
Date: September 15, 2024
Creative Team Lead: Alex Martinez

PROJECT OVERVIEW
-----------------
We're launching a comprehensive brand refresh to reposition our company as a lifestyle brand that celebrates authentic, everyday moments. This campaign will establish our new visual identity and brand voice across all touchpoints.

BACKGROUND
----------
Market research shows our current brand perception skews too corporate and product-focused. Customers want brands that understand their real lives - the messy, imperfect, beautiful everyday moments. Our competitors are winning by showing up authentically in customers' daily lives.

Current brand perception:
- "Professional but distant" - 42% of respondents
- "Quality products but impersonal" - 38%
- "Trustworthy but boring" - 31%

Desired brand perception:
- "Understands my lifestyle" - Target: 60%
- "Authentic and relatable" - Target: 55%
- "Inspires me daily" - Target: 50%

OBJECTIVES
----------
1. Shift brand perception from "corporate" to "lifestyle companion"
2. Increase brand affinity among millennials by 40%
3. Drive 25% increase in social media engagement
4. Achieve 90% positive sentiment in brand tracking
5. Increase unaided brand awareness from 23% to 35%
